ğŸŸ¦ # Redux

- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React
- It helps to manage global application state in a consistent way.

### ğŸ”µ Core Concepts of Redux

ğŸ”· **Store:** The single source of truth that holds the entire state of your application.
ğŸ”· **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in your app
ğŸ”· **Reducers:** Pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state
ğŸ”· **Dispatch:** The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() with an action
ğŸ”· **Middleware:** Provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the reducer

### ğŸ”µ Important Redux Hooks

ğŸ”·**useSelector():** Extracts data from the Redux store state.  
ğŸ”· **useDispatch():** Returns a reference to the dispatch function.
ğŸ”· **useStore():** Returns a reference to the Redux store (rarely needed).

### ğŸ”µ Redux Toolkit (Modern Redux)

ğŸŸ¢ Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.
**It includes:**<br>
ğŸ”· **configureStore():** Sets up a Redux store with good defaults.<br>  
ğŸ”· **createSlice():** Generates action creators and action types automatically.<br>  
ğŸ”· **createAsyncThunk():** Handles async logic.<br>
ğŸ”· **createEntityAdapter():** Manages normalized state.<br>  
ğŸ”· **createSelector():** Creates memoized selectors (from Reselect).<br>
