*** 9 Key strategy to optimize the API
*************************************************************************************************************

🟩 Use Caching
Store frequently accessed data in memory so you don’t have to fetch it from the database or other slow sources 
repeatedly. This drastically cuts down on response time.

🟩 Minimize Payload Size
Send only the necessary data in responses. Avoid sending large, unneeded chunks of data by filtering fields or 
compressing the payload, which reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up responses.

🟩 Use Asynchronous Processing
For tasks that don’t need an immediate response (like sending emails or processing large data sets), use 
asynchronous methods. This keeps the API responsive while the heavy work happens in the background.

🟩 Load Balancing
Distribute incoming API requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overloaded. This 
improves availability and handles more traffic efficiently.

🟩 Optimize Data Formats
Use lightweight data formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers instead of XML. Smaller data formats reduce the 
time spent parsing and transmitting data.

🟩 Connection Pooling
Reuse existing connections to the database or other services rather than opening a new one for each request. 
Connection pooling significantly reduces the overhead of establishing connections.

🟩 Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
For APIs serving static content (like images or scripts), use CDNs to deliver content faster by caching it closer
 to the user’s location, reducing latency.

🟩 Implement API Gateway
An API Gateway can help in routing requests, handling authentication, rate limiting, and caching. By offloading
 these tasks from your API, you can improve its overall performance.

🟩 Avoid Overfetching and Underfetching
Design your API endpoints to return just the right amount of data. GraphQL, for example, allows clients to 
request exactly what they need, avoiding overfetching and underfetching issues common in REST APIs.
