# ðŸŸ¦ Redux

- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React
- It helps to manage global application state in a consistent way.

### ðŸ”µ Core Concepts of Redux

**Store:** The single source of truth that holds the entire state of your application.<br>
**Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in your app.<br>
**Reducers:** Pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.<br>
**Dispatch:** The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() with an action.<br>
**Middleware:** Provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the reducer.<br>

### ðŸ”µ Important Redux Hooks

**useSelector():** Extracts data from the Redux store state.<br>
**useDispatch():** Returns a reference to the dispatch function.<br>
**useStore():** Returns a reference to the Redux store (rarely needed).<br>

### ðŸ”µ Redux Toolkit (Modern Redux)

Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.<br>

**It includes:** <br>
**configureStore():** Sets up a Redux store with good defaults.<br>
**createSlice():** Generates action creators and action types automatically.<br>
**createAsyncThunk():** Handles async logic.<br>
**createEntityAdapter():** Manages normalized state.<br>
**createSelector():** Creates memoized selectors (from Reselect).<br>
